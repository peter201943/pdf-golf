# Plan
- lots of itty bitty people
- you are titan, kicking around giant boulder
- boulder rocks and tumbles across land
- boulder falls onto people
- people scream when boulder near
- people go splat and ouch on boulder land
- giant laughs on mass destruction
- giant laughs louder on MORE destruction
- through in wilhelms for balance
- script choose sound to play randomly
- little people set traps
- giggle, snicker, mock
- maybe pitch-shift the voices?
- add echo for the titan
- maybe have titan walk around barefoot!
    - then place traps beneath feet!
    - jumps around, going "ouch ouch my foot!"
- depend on who wins
    - griefers: crowd cheer
    - titan: lone loud clapping
        - nahhh... just have him give out one great big evil laugh
- grunts on wind-up
    - yells on release
        - cannon on impact
            - whistle on flight
                - slam on impact
- big shadow under ball
