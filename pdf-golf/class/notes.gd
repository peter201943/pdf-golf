# Notes

## about
- an attempt to record documentation within godot itself
- please stop me if this seems like a terrible idea

## what we need
- terrain generation
	- [Voxel Tools for Godot](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel)
		- requires use of module -> needs to be compiled in
		- custom binaries are available
- global illumination
	- might be enabled by default in the voxel demos
