- ok, what if the golf ball was *really big*?
    - like, the size of a house or whatver
- and the person golfing was a giant
- the giant wants to plough over the villagers' houses with his golf ball
    - (they were stupid enough to build their homes in his golf-hole)
- the villages are the size of the golf ball (it's why they can't move it directly)
    - they also can't affect the player golfing
- but they can try and mess with the terrain/golf-ball to make it misbehave
- also be sure to fill it in with all manner of bowling sounds
